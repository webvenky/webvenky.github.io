I"¨<p>The OMNI-GLIDE is an autonomous omni-directional heavy-lifting mobile platform that can move in
any direction on a plane and also capable of in-point rotation (zero turning radius). Used together
with the tooling table, it can generally be used for the handling of large workpieces in space
constrained environements, especially for applications where multiple large workpieces have to be
transported in a very short time. Omni-directional vehicles is completely autonomous and can be
controlled just by providing high level action commands.</p>

<p>The OMNI-GLIDE is an omnidirectional heavy-duty AGV platform that lifts up to 10 Tons of
load. Eight highly durable mecanum wheels allow the robot to move freely in all directions and
to perform in-point rotation (zero turning radius). The robot gracefully executes autonomous
navigation with positioning accuracy less than Â±5 cm anywhere in the operation area (including
outdoor). It boosts productivity with a maximum speed of 0.7 m/s and a general endurance for
more than 10 hours per day. The robot skillfully positions itself under the table with an accuracy
of Â±3mm in order to precisely lock the pistons to the table before lifting. There are several other
intelligent features in the robot such as obstacle detection and auto-charging.</p>

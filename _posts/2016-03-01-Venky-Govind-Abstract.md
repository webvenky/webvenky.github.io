<b> Abstract </b>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Small-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (S-UAVs) have emerged as low-cost alternatives for aerial surveillance over cluttered environments such as forests and urban regions. However, they provide limited coverage owing to their low altitudes and short endurance. Therefore, a quick and effective surveillance necessitates optimal flying paths, maximizing ground visibility. The occlusion of ground points due to obstacles and vegetation is significant and has to be considered for designing the flight path. My research proposes probabilistic sensing model, faster visibility computations and also considers kinematic constraints of the vehicle to determine near-optimal flight paths for multiple S-UAVs. Simulation studies conducted on synthetic terrains and a reconstructed terrain, from satellite data of tree-cover and Digital Elevation Model (DEM), show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving the ground visibility.
